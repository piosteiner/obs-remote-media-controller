# Image Library Enhancements

## New Features Added

### 1. 🎨 Paste Images to Library
You can now paste images directly into the Image Library from your clipboard!

**How to use:**
1. Copy an image (from anywhere - browser, screenshot tool, etc.)
2. Go to the **Library** page
3. Click the green **"Paste"** button
4. If needed, click in the blue box and press **Ctrl+V** (or **Cmd+V** on Mac)
5. Image is uploaded to your library automatically! ✅

### 2. 📸 Multiple Upload Methods
The Library now supports three ways to add images:

| Method | Button | Description |
|--------|--------|-------------|
| **Clipboard Paste** | 🟢 Green "Paste" | Paste images from clipboard |
| **File Upload** | 🔵 Blue "Upload Images" | Select files from computer |
| **URL** | Coming soon | Add images by URL |

### 3. 🎯 Click to Assign Images to Slots
Library images can be quickly assigned to OBS slots:

1. Click on any image in the library
2. Enter the slot number (1-4)
3. Image is instantly assigned to that slot! ✨

**Visual feedback:**
- Hover over images to see "Click to assign" overlay
- Success toast confirms assignment
- Slot updates in real-time via WebSocket

### 4. 🔍 Search Images
Use the search bar to quickly find images by filename.

## Benefits

### For Meeting Presenters 📊

- **No interruptions**: Switch images without leaving OBS or interrupting screen share

### For Content Creators 🎬

## Technical Implementation

### Clipboard Paste Support
```javascript
// Dual approach for maximum compatibility
1. Try Clipboard API (navigator.clipboard.read())
2. Fallback to paste event listener (works everywhere!)
```

### Image URL Handling
```javascript
// Backend returns full URLs with PUBLIC_URL
url: "https://api.piogino.ch/obs/uploads/image.jpg"

// Frontend displays images correctly
<img src={image.url} />  // Works!
```

### Real-time Sync
```javascript
// When image assigned to slot
websocketService.updateSlot(slotId, imageUrl, imageId)
// All connected displays update instantly!
```

## User Experience Flow

### Workflow 2: Upload → Browse → Assign

## Testing Checklist

- [ ] Paste image to Library (fallback paste area)
- [ ] Upload multiple images to Library
- [ ] Search images in Library
- [ ] Click image to assign to slot
- [ ] Verify image loads in slot immediately
- [ ] Delete image from Library
- [ ] Verify deleted image removed from slots
- [ ] Test on different browsers
- [ ] Test on iPad with keyboard

## Known Limitations

1. **Clipboard permission**: Some browsers require user gesture for Clipboard API
   - **Solution**: We provide fallback paste area that always works
   
2. **Mobile clipboard**: Limited clipboard support on mobile browsers
   - **Solution**: Use Upload button which uses native file picker
   
3. **Large images**: Upload may be slow on poor connections
   - **Solution**: Backend limits file size (10MB), frontend shows progress

4. **Image persistence**: Images stored in-memory (backend restarts lose them)
   - **Solution**: Database integration coming in Phase 2

## Support

If paste doesn't work:
1. Check browser console for errors
2. Try the fallback paste area (blue box)
3. Use Upload button as alternative
4. Grant clipboard permission if prompted

Images not loading:
1. Check backend .env has PUBLIC_URL set
2. Verify backend is running (pm2 status)
3. Check Network tab for 404 errors
4. Ensure Nginx proxies /obs/uploads correctly
