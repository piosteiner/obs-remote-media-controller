## API Endpoints

All working at `https://api.piogino.ch/obs/api/`:

| Endpoint | Status |
|----------|--------|
| `GET /scenes` | ✅ Working |
| `POST /scenes` | ✅ Working |
| `POST /scenes/:id/load` | ✅ Working |
| `DELETE /scenes/:id` | ✅ Working |

## Expected Behavior

### Before (Mock Data)
```
Create scene → Only in browser memory
Refresh page → Scenes disappear ❌
Server restart → All scenes lost ❌
```

### After (Backend Integration)
```
Create scene → Saved to database ✅
Refresh page → Scenes persist ✅
Server restart → Scenes still there ✅
Multi-client → Real-time sync ✅
```

## Toast Notifications

You'll now see:
- 🟢 "Scene created successfully!"
- 🟢 "Scene loaded successfully!"
- 🟢 "Scene deleted successfully!"
- 🟢 "Scene loaded!" (from Control)
- 🔴 Error messages if something fails

## WebSocket Events

Backend broadcasts:
- `scene:created` → All clients get new scene
- `scene:loaded` → All clients update slots
- `scene:deleted` → All clients remove scene
- `slots:update` → Display pages refresh

## No Backend Changes Needed!

The backend is already deployed and working:
- ✅ All endpoints functional
- ✅ Database persistent storage
- ✅ WebSocket broadcasting
- ✅ CORS configured

**Only frontend needs deployment** 🎉

## Verification

After deploying, check:

### Browser Console
Should see:
```
✅ Scenes loaded: [...]
✅ WebSocket connected
✅ No errors
```

### Network Tab
Should see:
```
GET /api/scenes → 200 OK
POST /api/scenes → 201 Created
POST /api/scenes/1/load → 200 OK
DELETE /api/scenes/1 → 200 OK
```

### Backend Logs (Optional)
SSH to VPS and check:
```bash
pm2 logs obs-backend
```

Should see:
```
✅ Scene created: "Test Scene"
✅ Scene loaded: 1
✅ Scene deleted: 1
```

## Rollback (If Needed)

If something breaks:
```bash
cd frontend
git checkout HEAD~1 src/pages/Scenes.jsx src/pages/Control.jsx
npm run deploy
```

But it shouldn't - all changes tested! ✅

**After:** Scenes persist, sync in real-time, fully functional  

**Deploy time:** ~3-4 minutes
